As Ravi has only chosen a minor in Computer Science this past year and was unfamiliar with coding languages beforehand, he has not completed any projects as of yet. However, he is currently designing two programs that will be done by the end of the summer. He will update this page as soon as they are finished, but for now he asks you to be patient.
